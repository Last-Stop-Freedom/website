        <h3>Last Stop: Freedom - Meeting Guide</h3>

        <p>
          Welcome to the Last Stop group of Alcoholics Anonymous.
          This is an open meeting. We meet every Sunday evening at 7:30 p.m. We begin this meeting with a
          moment of silence followed by the <b>Step Three Prayer</b> (p.63). Let us take that moment now:
          </p>
        <p className="quote">
          God…I offer myself to Thee—to build with me and to do with me as Thou
          wilt. Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I might better do Thy will.
          Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness to
          those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love and Thy Way of Life. May I
          do Thy will always.
          </p>
        <p>
          My name is……..and I am…. (Note to Chairperson:  please qualify briefly)
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Secretary will now make announcements for the benefit of the Group and AA.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our Group’s primary purpose is to discuss recovery from alcoholism through the Twelve Step program
            as described in the book <em>Alcoholics Anonymous.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          We especially welcome newcomers looking for a solution to a seemingly hopeless state of mind and
          body. If you want to get well, we will do anything to help. We offer friendship and fellowship. We
          encourage you to listen to those who have recovered. If you want what we have and are willing to go to
          any length to recover, then you are ready to take certain steps.
            </p>

        <p>
          Would those who are currently willing to work with others please raise their hands.
            </p>
        <p>
          To find someone to take you through the 12 Steps, speak to me or one of our members after the
          meeting.
        </p>

        <p>
          We believe in the original, undiluted message of recovery in the Big Book. Sponsors work one-on-one
          with newcomers to guide them through the 12 Step process. We help newcomers to understand how the
          experience, strength and hope of the original 100 members, and later millions of recovered alcoholics,
          personally relate to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us take a moment to ‘check-in’ by going around the room and introducing ourselves.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          It’s now time for the sharing part of the meeting. We shall be interested to hear from those who are
          getting results from this Book, particularly those who have commenced work with other alcoholics.
          </p>
        <p>
          We have no attitude of “Holier Than Thou”, nothing whatever except the sincere desire to be helpful. That
          there are no fees to pay, no axes to grind, no people to please, no lectures to be endured—these are the
          conditions we have found most effective. We have ceased fighting anything or anyone, even alcohol.
          Love and tolerance of others is our code. We don’t talk down to anyone from a moral or spiritual hilltop;
          we simply lay out the kit of spiritual tools for your inspection and show others how they worked for us. <b>To
          show other alcoholics precisely how we have recovered is the main purpose of the first 164 pages
          of the <em>Big Book</em>.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would like to share a step experience, ask a question about the 12 Step program, or seek a
          solution to a particular problem, please wait until you are acknowledged by the Chairperson. Please
          keep your sharing to approximately two to three minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cross talk is permitted, but only as a response to cite experiences and answers as found in the text of the
          Big Book.
        </p>
        <p>
          (Note to Chairperson: You can either open the floor for Q &amp; A or select a reading—a paragraph or two of
          your choosing from the first 164 pages of the Big Book or Appendix 2.)
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h4>
          Our time is up!
        </h4>
        <p>
          There are no dues or fees for AA. membership. We are fully self-supporting through our own voluntary
          contributions. Our needs are simple, a place to hold our meeting and literature to help carry the message.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, <b>studying the steps is not the same as taking the Steps.</b> The Big Book says, “Here are the
        steps we took” NOT “here are the steps we read and talked about.” The AA pioneers proved that action,
        not knowledge, produced the spiritual awakening that resulted in recovery from alcoholism or addiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, we recover by the steps we take, not the meetings we make!
        </p>
        <p>
          Would those who are currently willing to work with others please raise their hands.

          To find someone to take you through the 12 Steps, speak to me or one of our members after the
          meeting.
        </p>
        <p>
          We conclude our meeting with a Step Seven Prayer (p. 76):
        </p>
        <p className="quote">
          My Creator, I am now willing that you should have all of me, good and
          bad. I pray that you now remove from me every single defect of
          character which stands in the way of my usefulness to you and my
          fellows. Grant me strength, as I go out from here, to do your bidding.
          Amen.
          </p>
